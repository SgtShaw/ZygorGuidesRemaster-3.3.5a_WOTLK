## Version

- Version: ![Version](https://img.shields.io/github/commit-activity/t/ErebusAres/ZygorGuidesRemaster-3.3.5a_WOTLK?label=Version%203.0.&color=1f6feb)
- Intended client: **WotLK 3.3.5a / 12340**

## Who This Is For

This addon is intended for:

- World of Warcraft **WotLK 3.3.5a (build 12340)** clients
- Private server environments (for example TrinityCore-based servers)
- Players who want the classic Zygor guide experience with a cleaner UI

This project is primarily focused on **WotLK 3.3.5a**. Other clients may work, but support and testing are centered on 3.3.5a.

## What You Get

- Step-by-step leveling and quest progression guidance.
- Arrow and waypoint navigation while you play.
- Structured objective flow (accept, complete, and turn-in).
- A cleaner, more readable viewer UI designed for long play sessions.
- Includes talent guidance via the bundled `ZygorTalentAdvisor` module inside `ZygorGuidesViewerRM`.

## What Stayed the Same

Core 3.3.5a-era behavior is preserved:

- Guide parser and step engine.
- Map and waypoint workflow.
- Legacy guide execution patterns.
- Base `ZygorTalentAdvisor` behavior and structure.

## What's New in the Remaster

- Cleaner, retail-inspired UI shell for both guide browsing and options.
- New standalone Guide Manager (Home / Featured / Current / Recent) with category sidebar, search, favorites, and folder-style tree behavior.
- New in-app Options experience with categorized navigation, searchable pages, and improved layout consistency.
- Remastered waypoint arrow and objective text styling updates, including clearer action/title/distance presentation and distance color gradients.
- Accessibility improvements including colorblind presets and simplified noun-color handling for better readability.
- Ongoing compatibility focus for 3.3.5a environments and expanded guide coverage where applicable.

## Included Components

1. `ZygorGuidesViewerRM` - Remastered viewer and guide runtime.
2. `ZygorTalentAdvisor` - bundled inside `ZygorGuidesViewerRM` and loaded as part of the addon package.

## Key Controls

- Minimap icon:
  - Left-click toggles the guide viewer.
  - Right-click opens the Guide Manager.
  - Shift + Right-click opens options.
- Viewer toolbar:
  - Guides left-click opens the legacy quick guide dropdown.
  - Guides right-click opens the Guide Manager.
  - Settings left-click opens quick settings.
  - Settings right-click opens Guide Manager options.

## Quick Install

### Installation Overview

1. Download the ZIP.
2. Extract to `Interface\AddOns\`.
3. Launch the game.
4. Enable the addon.

### Detailed Steps

1. Close World of Warcraft.
2. Open `%WoWFolder%\Interface\AddOns\`.
3. Remove older folders if present:
   - `ZygorGuidesViewer`
   - `ZygorTalentAdvisor`
   - This avoids mixed files from older releases.
4. Copy this folder into `AddOns`:
   - `ZygorGuidesViewerRM`
5. Confirm the top-level folder exists:
   - `Interface\AddOns\ZygorGuidesViewerRM\ZygorGuidesViewerRM.toc`
6. Launch the game and enable the addon.

## Common Issues

**Addon not showing in-game**

- Make sure the folder structure is:
  - `Interface\AddOns\ZygorGuidesViewerRM\ZygorGuidesViewerRM.toc`
- Do not nest folders (no double folder level).

**Out of date warning**

- Enable **Load out of date AddOns** on the character select screen.

**Guide not progressing**

- Some imported guides may not fully match 3.3.5a data.
- See the Known Issues section below.

## Update Notes

1. Install or update the `ZygorGuidesViewerRM` folder as a single addon package.
2. `/reload` is usually enough for Lua-only changes.
3. A full relaunch is safer when files, XML includes, assets, or bundled modules change.

## Guide Profiles

- Current default guide content is the remastered, TrinityCore-oriented profile for WotLK 3.3.5a private servers.
- An optional Alliance fallback profile exists at `Guides\Leveling_Original\ZygorGuidesAlliance.lua`.
- That fallback is original, unmodified classic Zygor content and should only be used if the remastered default route is problematic for a specific session.

## Localization

Localization key coverage is complete across shipped locales (`Main` + `NPCs`) with placeholder and format-consistency checks.

Current focus is community QA review:

- natural phrasing in live gameplay context,
- terminology consistency,
- official localized NPC proper names,
- encoding and readability verification.

Localization was largely AI-assisted and should be treated as needing community review until native-speaker QA confirms quality.

### Community Credits

- [`mikki33`](https://github.com/mikki33) for providing Russian localization changes and review updates.

## Support Wanted (Localization QA)

If you can validate translations in-game, your help is very welcome.

Please report:

- mistranslations,
- awkward phrasing,
- broken placeholders (`%s`, `%d`, `|n`, color codes),
- incorrect NPC names,
- encoding artifacts.

## Changelog

### Revision 119 - 3.0.119

- Optimized Quest Tracking for Wrath with throttled quest-log rescans, completed-goal synchronization, and a lightweight safety polling pass. 
- Reduced quest-log event storm overhead while preserving the existing 3.3.5a-safe fixed-entry scan behavior.
- Improved imported guide condition compatibility by adding missing helpers such as `warlockpet`, `haveq`, `zone`, and `weaponskill`.
- Fixed mixed and standalone `|only if` parsing so race/class and condition-based retail-import steps hide correctly.
- Fixed requirement handling for both string and table-based step requirements.
- Fixed retail-style `goto` parsing so waypoints create correctly for imported guides using `Zone x,y` formatting.
- Resolved several retail-import progression/runtime errors that were blocking starter and leveling guide flow.

### Revision 118 - 3.0.118

- Added a hidden `retail` Guide Browser search term for guides loaded from the `Guides/Retail` import set.
- Kept retail-imported guides in their correct functional categories instead of splitting them into a separate `Retail` tab.
- Fixed a Wrath taxi lookup error in waypoint travel advice where taxi entries could be numeric and crash guide progression.
- Improved Gear Finder refresh behavior so inventory changes can invalidate stale results and rescan more reliably.
- Reduced Guide Browser open-time lag by avoiding expensive automatic guide-detail work on the default/open state.
- Improved lazy-guide browser behavior so selected guide details can still populate when needed without restoring eager startup parsing.
- Replaced the legacy options-page guide dropdown with a lighter current-guide display and an `Open Guide Browser` button.
- Fixed the new `Open Guide Browser` options button so it opens the Guide Home view instead of throwing an AceConfig error or toggling the browser closed.
- Added missing condition-environment helpers used by guides, including `hasbuff`, `nobuff`, `invehicle`, `outvehicle`, and `itemcount`.
- Fixed the `Stat Weights` class dropdown so class names display correctly on Wrath again.

### Revision 117 - 3.0.117

- Updated All Versions to 3.0.117 to be in line with github revision number.
- No other changes were done on this pass.

### Revision 116 - 3.0.116

- Added a dedicated `Optimization` options tab.
- Added configurable internal waypoint arrow refresh rate options (`20 FPS`, `30 FPS`, `60 FPS`, `Unlimited`).
- Surfaced additional travel performance options for route calculation budget and startup travel-link building.
- Replaced eager startup guide parsing with header-only startup plus on-demand guide parsing.
- Added a small parsed-guide cache to reduce long-session memory growth while keeping guide switching transparent.
- Updated the Guide Browser details pane so single-clicking a guide loads that guide's step count on demand instead of showing `Steps: 0`.
- Reduced login-time memory usage and improved startup responsiveness significantly on Wrath 3.3.5a.
- Added the ability to close the Gear Finder by pressing your CharacterFrame hotkey `Default: C`.

### Revision 115 - 3.0.115

- Added @Advocaite 's changes and Retail backports:
- Guide Finder
- Auction Tool
- Retail Guides
- Gear Advisor
- Stat Weights

### Revision 114 - 3.0.114

- Restored the safe Wrath 3D target preview framing fix for long-body creature targets without relying on `!!!ClassicAPI`.
- Localized the newer Wrath UI additions, including Target Preview, Gear Finder, and related popup/status text.
- Reworked the options layout to better match the retail-style flow while keeping `Remaster` as the default skin.
- Improved options navigation with better tab ordering/icons and moved duplicate legacy guide copies into `Guides/Archived`.

## Notes

- Intended target client is **WotLK 3.3.5a (12340)**.
- It may work on other versions, but compatibility is not guaranteed.
- `ZygorTalentAdvisor` is bundled and loaded from within `ZygorGuidesViewerRM`.

## Known Issues

- Arrow scale/position drift:
  - On some setups, changing Waypoint Arrow Scale can shift the arrow position unexpectedly.
  - Resetting arrow position may not fully normalize the anchor in all UI/minimap addon combinations.
  - Status: deferred for now.

- Some imported guides may be incomplete or not fully aligned to 3.3.5a data.
- If a guide behaves incorrectly, disable it in `ZygorGuidesViewerRM/Guides/Autoload.xml` and report it.
